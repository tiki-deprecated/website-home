*Heads up! We don’t do pitch decks. It’s just not our style. We believe a well-written blog to be less ambiguous, more
transparent, and easier to understand. Our users will read this.*

User data. We all know this problem; we’re suffering.

The root cause is simple. We, as users, don’t have a say when it comes to **our data**. When companies and governments
make the decisions, we’re left to deal with the repercussions.

We proposed the following solution. As users, we should be able to see the data collected on us, control how its use,
and when sold, we deserve to get paid for it — basic ownership rights. We expect this for our house, car, phone, or
anything else we own. Why not our data?

We created TIKI in Dec. ’20 with three core values, user-centricity, trust, and transparency. On Jan 1, We published our
vision. One app that makes data ownership easy. Just install the app and link your accounts (
join [waitlist](https://mytiki.com/#signup)). Quickly understand what’s collected about you. Easily control your privacy
from one place and, if you want, directly sell your data to companies you choose.

People responded. In the first two months, 10k users signed up for our beta. This week, less than four months in, we’ll
cross **50k** users. Users hear about TIKI mainly from small influencer programs with a bit of digital ad spend for a
CAC of ~$0.50.

We oversubscribed ($175k) a small [Pre-Seed](https://mytiki.com/blog/pre-seed-program) in March to continue the user
growth momentum, with a goal of 100k users at the end of May. We’re currently conducting an incremental [release]()
program with ~500 participants, resulting in a killer MVP in June.

Giving users control of their data doesn’t mean cutting businesses off. Users are excited to share their data with
businesses they trust for fair and transparent compensation. Thru TIKI, millions of businesses, for the first time, can
access ethical, affordable, and useable data. A straightforward broker model, TIKI provides data as a service. Charging
companies a transaction fee (10%). Users receive compensation based on the data they contribute.

Our model:  
*Try with your numbers. There are 30M SMBs in the US, and with the upending of major markets like the $80B mobile
digital ad market, there’s no shortage of businesses who need data.*

> > For 100k users to earn $10/month. TIKI needs 1k paying companies at $100/month or 10k companies at $10/month.
> >
> > At $10 /user/month * 10% fee = $1 MRR/user
> >
> > 100k users * $1 MRR/user = $100k MRR

The question we’re always asked, what if FB or Google decides to do this? Within TIKI is a massive network effect; with
each new user, all of our data becomes more valuable. However, the best moat is always user loyalty. We build loyalty
with user-centricity, trust, and transparency. To this end, we publish everything, including our code — a user-first
approach creates sustainable growth. There is a future in which the tech giants and TIKI happily coexist; just look at
Roku and Netflix, HBO, Disney, etc.

We’re raising a seed round in May to reach 1 million users by the end of the year. Along the way, we will deliver an
amazing product and, yes, even generate some revenue. TIKI is user-first. Users deserve control of their data. If this
mission resonates, we’d love to hear from you.
